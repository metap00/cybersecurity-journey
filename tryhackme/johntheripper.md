## John Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of John the Ripper commands is as follows. We will cover the specific options and modifiers used as we use them.

john [options] [file path]

 - john: Invokes the John the Ripper program
 - [options]: Specifies the options you want to use
 - [file path]: The file containing the hash you’re trying to crack; if it’s in the same directory, you won’t need to name a path, just the file.

## Automatic Cracking

John has built-in features to detect what type of hash it’s being given and to select appropriate rules and formats to crack it for you; this isn’t always the best idea as it can be unreliable, but if you can’t identify what hash type you’re working with and want to try cracking it, it can be a good option! To do this, we use the following syntax:

john --wordlist=[path to wordlist] [path to file]

 - --wordlist=: Specifies using wordlist mode, reading from the file that you supply in the provided path
 -  [path to wordlist]: The path to the wordlist you’re using, as described in the previous task

Example Usage:

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash_to_crack.txt

## Identifying Hashes

Sometimes, John won’t play nicely with automatically recognising and loading hashes, but that’s okay! We can use other tools to identify the hash and then set John to a specific format. There are multiple ways to do this, such as using an online hash identifier like hashes.com. I like to use a tool called hash-identifier, a Python tool that is super easy to use and will tell you what different types of hashes the one you enter is likely to be, giving you more options if the first one fails.

To use hash-identifier, you can use wget or curl to download the Python file hash-id.py from its GitLab page(opens in new tab). Then, launch it with python3 hash-id.py and enter the hash you’re trying to identify. It will give you a list of the most probable formats. These two steps are shown in the terminal below.

## Format-Specific Cracking

Once you have identified the hash that you’re dealing with, you can tell John to use it while cracking the provided hash using the following syntax:

john --format=[format] --wordlist=[path to wordlist] [path to file]

- --format=: This is the flag to tell John that you’re giving it a hash of a specific format and to use the following format to crack it
- [format]: The format that the hash is in

Example Usage:

john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash_to_crack.txt

A Note on Formats:

When you tell John to use formats, if you’re dealing with a standard hash type, e.g. md5 as in the example above, you have to prefix it with raw- to tell John you’re just dealing with a standard hash type, though this doesn’t always apply. To check if you need to add the prefix or not, you can list all of John’s formats using john --list=formats and either check manually or grep for your hash type using something like john --list=formats | grep -iF "md5".

##Unshadowing

John can be very particular about the formats it needs data in to be able to work with it; for this reason, to crack /etc/shadow passwords, you must combine it with the /etc/passwd file for John to understand the data it’s being given. To do this, we use a tool built into the John suite of tools called unshadow. The basic syntax of unshadow is as follows:

unshadow [path to passwd] [path to shadow]

- unshadow: Invokes the unshadow tool
- [path to passwd]: The file that contains the copy of the /etc/passwd file you’ve taken from the target machine
- [path to shadow]: The file that contains the copy of the /etc/shadow file you’ve taken from the target machine

Example Usage:

unshadow local_passwd local_shadow > unshadowed.txt

##Cracking

We can then feed the output from unshadow, in our example use case called unshadowed.txt, directly into John. We should not need to specify a mode here as we have made the input specifically for John; however, in some cases, you will need to specify the format as we have done previously using: --format=sha512crypt

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=sha512crypt unshadowed.txt

##Practical

Now, see if you can follow the process to crack the password hash of the root user provided in the etchashes.txt file. Good luck! The files are located in ~/John-the-Ripper-The-Basics/Task06/.

##Using Single Crack Mode

To use single crack mode, we use roughly the same syntax that we’ve used so far; for example, if we wanted to crack the password of the user named “Mike”, using the single mode, we’d use:

john --single --format=[format] [path to file]

 - --single: This flag lets John know you want to use the single hash-cracking mode
 - --format=[format]: As always, it is vital to identify the proper format.

Example Usage:

john --single --format=raw-sha256 hashes.txt

 A Note on File Formats in Single Crack Mode:

If you’re cracking hashes in single crack mode, you need to change the file format that you’re feeding John for it to understand what data to create a wordlist from. You do this by prepending the hash with the username that the hash belongs to, so according to the above example, we would change the file hashes.txt

From 1efee03cdcb96d90ad48ccc7b8666033

To mike:1efee03cdcb96d90ad48ccc7b8666033

## Zip2John

Similarly to the unshadow tool we used previously, we will use the zip2john tool to convert the Zip file into a hash format that John can understand and hopefully crack. The primary usage is like this:

zip2john [options] [zip file] > [output file]

- [options]: Allows you to pass specific checksum options to zip2john; this shouldn’t often be necessary
- [zip file]: The path to the Zip file you wish to get the hash of
- >: This redirects the output from this command to another file
- >[output file]: This is the file that will store the output

Example Usage

zip2john zipfile.zip > zip_hash.txt

Cracking

We’re then able to take the file we output from zip2john in our example use case, zip_hash.txt, and, as we did with unshadow, feed it directly into John as we have made the input specifically for it.

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt zip_hash.txt

## Rar2John

Almost identical to the zip2john tool, we will use the rar2john tool to convert the RAR file into a hash format that John can understand. The basic syntax is as follows:

rar2john [rar file] > [output file]

- rar2john: Invokes the rar2john tool
- [rar file]: The path to the RAR file you wish to get the hash of
- >: This redirects the output of this command to another file
- [output file]: This is the file that will store the output from the command

Example Usage

/opt/john/rar2john rarfile.rar > rar_hash.txt

Cracking

Once again, we can take the file we output from rar2john in our example use case, rar_hash.txt, and feed it directly into John as we did with zip2john.

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt rar_hash.txt

##SSH2John

Who could have guessed it, another conversion tool? Well, that’s what working with John is all about. As the name suggests, ssh2john converts the id_rsa private key, which is used to log in to the SSH session, into a hash format that John can work with. Jokes aside, it’s another beautiful example of John’s versatility. The syntax is about what you’d expect. Note that if you don’t have ssh2john installed, you can use ssh2john.py, located in the /opt/john/ssh2john.py. If you’re doing this on the AttackBox, replace the ssh2john command with python3 /opt/john/ssh2john.py or on Kali, python /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py.

ssh2john [id_rsa private key file] > [output file]

- ssh2john: Invokes the ssh2john tool
- [id_rsa private key file]: The path to the id_rsa file you wish to get the hash of
- >: This is the output director. We’re using it to redirect the output from this command to another file.
- [output file]: This is the file that will store the output from

Example Usage

/opt/john/ssh2john.py id_rsa > id_rsa_hash.txt

Cracking

For the final time, we’re feeding the file we output from ssh2john, which in our example use case is called id_rsa_hash.txt and, as we did with rar2john, we can use this seamlessly with John:

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt id_rsa_hash.txt
